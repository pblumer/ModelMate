# Architecture Overview

This document provides a first conceptual view of the ModelMates architecture. It is intended as a high-level blueprint and will be refined as the project evolves.

## Core Concepts

- **Central Graph-Based Repository:**  
  All model artifacts (business models, software architectures, process and data models) are stored in a unified graph structure. Nodes represent entities (e.g., applications, services, processes), and edges represent relationships (e.g., "runs on", "depends on", "part of").

- **API and CLI Interfaces:**  
  A unified API (e.g., REST or GraphQL) and a Command-Line Interface (CLI) will provide access to the repository. Both human users and AI assistants can interact with the system through these interfaces. All changes to the model (create, update, delete) are performed via these well-defined entry points.

- **AI Integration Layer:**  
  An AI-driven module interprets natural language instructions and translates them into model manipulations (e.g., "Add a new microservice named 'OrderProcessor' that depends on 'UserService'"). The AI module interfaces with the API or CLI to perform the necessary operations on the graph.

- **Visualization & Export:**  
  A set of visualization components will generate diagrams and views from the graph. This includes standard notations like ArchiMate, UML, BPMN, and ERD. These diagrams may be generated on-demand and provided in various formats.

## Technology Considerations

- **Graph Database:**  
  Potential candidates include Neo4j (community edition), JanusGraph, or another open-source graph database. The choice will depend on complexity, scalability, and performance requirements.

- **API Layer:**  
  A REST or GraphQL interface implemented in a language like TypeScript/Node.js, Java/Kotlin, or Python. This layer handles authentication, validation, and orchestrates model operations against the graph.

- **CLI:**  
  A command-line tool that interacts with the API. Useful for automation, scripting, and quick model updates.

- **AI Integration:**  
  Could involve connecting to a hosted LLM (e.g., OpenAI) or a self-hosted model. Additional logic might be required to transform natural language requests into deterministic model changes, possibly using vector databases and embeddings.

- **Visualization:**  
  Generating diagrams can be done by exporters that translate the graph structure into formats understood by PlantUML, Graphviz, or other diagramming tools.

## Future Extensions

- **Versioning & History Tracking:**  
  Introducing model version control, allowing users to review changes over time.

- **Plugins & Adapters:**  
  Support for additional modeling languages, external tools, or CI/CD integration.

- **Security & Access Control:**  
  Implementing fine-grained permissions to control who can view or modify certain parts of the model.
